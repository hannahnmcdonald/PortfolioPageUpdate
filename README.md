# PortfolioPageUpdate

Deployed Application: https://hannahnmcdonald.github.io/PortfolioPageUpdate/

# Description

A portfolio web page to display my work, resume, and a brief bio to show to employers. This portfolio is a concise and simple web page that is mobile responsive which displays all the applications I have created along with links to their deployed site. I have a link to my resume as well for future employers to view in addition to my LinkedIn page and my github where they can find more of my work and projects.

# Credits

Bootstrap! 

It was so nice to work with a CSS framework this time around making my portfolio! I used bootstrap layouts and made some minor changes to the link icons and photos involved.
